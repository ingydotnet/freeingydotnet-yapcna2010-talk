     When a person spends their time on the interest of
     others, I label this being Bound. Most people are
     Bound by a job, where they trade their time and
     creative resources for money to pay for things
     they need to live. A person can spend their time
     being Bound or being Free. Obviously, being Bound
     allows you to trade your time for money, but
     rarely can you trade your Free time for money.
