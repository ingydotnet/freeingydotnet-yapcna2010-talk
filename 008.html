     Can you help me be Free all the time? Maybe you
     are a company who uses some of these projects.
     Maybe you are a philanthopist who believes in the
     tenets of Acmeism. Maybe you are one who can
     afford to offer me the equivalent of a decent
     salary, so that I may put all my effort into this
     work, and continue to evangelize it. Are you? Will
     you? If Yes, contact me. In the meantime I will be
     spending my Free time on these exciting things.
