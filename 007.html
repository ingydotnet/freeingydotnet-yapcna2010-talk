     All of the programming source code for these
     projects and many others is Freely available my
     GitHub page and also distributed on services like
     CPAN and PyPI, as appropriate. As often as
     possible, I give Free presentations about these
     projects at conferences, workshops and user group
     meetings around the world, to people of all
     programming backgrounds. I spend time talking and
     working with them to further these and similar
     works.
